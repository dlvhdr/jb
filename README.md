Task Runner

WIP.

Goal of this project is the ability to add new tasks from any shell, and have a background process to run those jobs.
There is also a TUI to see jobs status and output and perform actions on them.
The main problem this comes to solve is having to create new shells just to run blocking jobs, as alternatives like /dev/null and bg are not good enough.
